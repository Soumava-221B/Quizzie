# Quizzie: Web App for creating instant quiz

## Description

Quizzie allows multiple users to create individual accounts, providing each user with a personalized dashboard to design and manage quizzes efficiently.

Users can create quizzes with a flexible structureâ€”each question can have multiple answer options. They have the option to develop single-question quizzes or comprehensive quizzes containing up to five questions.

To enhance engagement tracking, the platform records the number of impressions, defined as the number of times a quiz link is opened. Quizzes that receive more than ten impressions are classified as "trending." Additionally, robust analytics tools are integrated to monitor quiz performance, offering insights into user engagement and overall effectiveness.
