# Quizzie: Web App for creating instant quiz

## Description

Quizzie allows multiple users to create individual accounts, providing each user with a personalized dashboard to design and manage quizzes efficiently.

Users can create quizzes with a flexible structure—each question can have multiple answer options. They have the option to develop single-question quizzes or comprehensive quizzes containing up to five questions.

To enhance engagement tracking, the platform records the number of impressions, defined as the number of times a quiz link is opened. Quizzes that receive more than ten impressions are classified as "trending." Additionally, robust analytics tools are integrated to monitor quiz performance, offering insights into user engagement and overall effectiveness.

## Technologies Used:

<br> • MongDB: For indexing, replication and aggregation framework, stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON.
<br> •  Express.js (Backend Framework): Follows the MVC architecture, making it easy to structure applications.
<br> • React.js (Frontend Library): Used for state management hooks like useState and useEffect.
<br> • Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment, It is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, making it fast and efficient.
<br> • Redux (State Management Library): Helped in managing complex application states and makes debugging easier using Redux DevTools.

## Why These Technologies?

These technologies together form the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, which is widely used for full-stack JavaScript development. Adding Redux further enhances the efficiency of state management in React applications. This stack is popular because:

<br> • <strong>Full JavaScript Stack:</strong> Uses JavaScript for both frontend and backend, simplifying development.
<br> • <strong>High Performance:</strong> Node.js and MongoDB offer scalable and high-performance solutions.
<br> • <strong>Rich Ecosystem:</strong> A large community and numerous libraries speed up development.
<br> • <strong>Flexibility:</strong> Suitable for both small projects and large-scale enterprise applications.
